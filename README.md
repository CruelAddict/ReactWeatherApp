## React weather app

This is an ITMO web development lab.

Install dependencies:

### `npm i`

Run it in dev mode with

### `npm start`

Or build it in prod mode with

### `npm run build`
(might be unstable atm)

You might also want to run unit tests with

### `npm run test`

This application has a backend. You might check it there https://github.com/CruelAddict/weather-app-backend

The master branch is connected to it. If you don't want to practice any kind of voodoo, make sure you run the backend server **before** the react dev server so it takes the 3000th port.
The gh-pages version that you might find [there](https://crueladdict.github.io/ReactWeatherApp/ "there") is connected to localstorege. You won't find any fancy tooltips and validation stuff there, sorry :(.
